# EatDaBurger

This is a simple Full-Stack application where the user can choose a burger and devour it. The user can add a new burger too. After a burger is devoured, it moves into the "Burgers you have devouvred" section.

This application consists of the 3 stacks - mysql for the database, node.js and express for the backend and handlebars for the front-end.
